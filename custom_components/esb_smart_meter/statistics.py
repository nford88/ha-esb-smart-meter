"""Backfill ESB history into Home Assistant long-term statistics.

The regular sensors only accrue from the moment the integration is set up.
Because ESB CSV exports contain months of half-hourly history, we can push
that history straight into the recorder as *external* statistics so it shows
up on the Energy dashboard with the correct dates.

Cumulative sums are always continued from whatever the recorder already holds
rather than recomputed from zero. The CSVs on disk are a moving window - the
`prune` service deliberately trims them - so rebuilding the running total from
the current files would restart it partway through history and leave a cliff in
the Energy dashboard at the boundary. Seeding from the stored sum keeps the
series monotonic no matter how much of the source data has aged out.
